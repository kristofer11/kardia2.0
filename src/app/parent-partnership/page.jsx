                        We know that with school primarily done at home, that life can get in the way of everyday routine. Our program is flexible enough to work with each family in the routine that is their best fit. Families are held accountable to get the work done but are given tools to be even more successful in those busy moments.

                        We hold each child to high academic standards and know that they are capable of meeting those standards. With parent help at home, we are able to help each child live to their full academic potential. With these high standards, comes accountability from parents and teachers to do their best, as well as grace when things donâ€™t go as planned.

                        Education is a privilege and we want our students to see it as such. Parents will educate their children at home while modeling a passion for learning to help create a lifelong learner in each of their children.
